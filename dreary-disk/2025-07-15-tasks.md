# Tasks for 2025-07-15

Here is a task list for tomorrow, covering the remaining items from our Product Requirements Document and general cleanup:

1.  **Review and Refine Schema.org Markup:**
    *   Thoroughly check the existing `itemscope`, `itemtype`, and `itemprop` attributes in `src/components/IsotopeGallery.astro` to ensure they are valid and comprehensive for `ImageObject` and `ItemList`.

2.  **Enhance Accessibility:**
    *   Review all interactive elements (filter buttons) for proper ARIA attributes (`aria-pressed`, `aria-controls`, `role`).
    *   Ensure keyboard navigation is intuitive for filter buttons.
    *   Verify that the "no results" message correctly uses `aria-live` for screen reader announcements.

3.  **Cleanup Debugging Code:**
    *   Remove all `console.log` statements from `src/scripts/isotope-init.js`.
    *   Remove any temporary CSS (like borders or background colors) from `src/components/IsotopeGallery.astro` that were added for debugging.

4.  **Final Verification:**
    *   Confirm that all functional requirements (filtering, responsiveness, "no results" message) are working perfectly across different screen sizes.
    *   Ensure the component is reusable and configurable as per the PRD.

5.  **Review Unnecessary Files:**
    *   Consider removing `/Users/danielkause/Desktop/SILBERBLICK/dreary-disk/src/pages/collection-test-tasks.md` (likely redundant task notes).
    *   Consider removing `/Users/danielkause/Desktop/SILBERBLICK/dreary-disk/src/pages/PlayersClub.pdf` (unused asset/test file).
    *   **Decision needed:** Do you want to keep `/Users/danielkause/Desktop/SILBERBLICK/dreary-disk/src/pages/PRD-Isotope.md` for documentation, or should it also be removed?

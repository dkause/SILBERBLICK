# Gemini Project Notes: dreary-disk

This file contains notes, decisions, and solutions implemented by the Gemini agent for this project.

## Project: Dynamic Photo Detail Pages (2025-07-17)

### Core Decisions

*   **URL Structure:** Detail pages will use a `kategorie/slug` structure (e.g., `/architektur/architektur-agricultural-landscape-view`). The slug is automatically generated by Astro from the markdown filename.
*   **Hero Image Logic (for Series):**
    *   An image with `isHero: true` in its frontmatter is prioritized as the main hero image.
    *   If multiple images in a series are marked as hero, the first one encountered will be used.
    *   If no image is explicitly marked as hero, the first image in the series serves as the default hero.
*   **Styling:** Initial implementation will focus on HTML structure and logic. Global styles from `@src/styles/global.css` will be imported for basic consistency. Advanced styling will be handled later.
*   **Content Schema (`src/content/config.ts`):** The `category` field in the `fotos` collection schema will be mandatory, as it is a required part of the URL structure.

## Lessons Learned from Interaction (2025-07-15)

### 1. Importance of Console Debugging for Client-Side Issues
*   **Observation:** When dealing with client-side JavaScript problems (e.g., Isotope not initializing or filtering), the browser's developer console is the primary tool for diagnosis.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Utilize `console.log` extensively to trace script execution flow, verify element presence, and inspect variable states. This is crucial for pinpointing where a script might be failing or making incorrect assumptions.

### 2. Handling Optional DOM Elements in JavaScript
*   **Observation:** If a JavaScript script relies on DOM elements that might be conditionally rendered (e.g., filter buttons that can be hidden via a component prop), the script must be robust enough to handle their absence.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Always wrap logic dependent on optional DOM elements within `if` conditions (e.g., `if (element)`). This prevents `null` reference errors and ensures that core functionalities (like Isotope initialization and layout) can proceed even if auxiliary elements are not present.

### 3. Git Workflow and Environment Limitations
*   **Observation:** Direct execution of combined `git add .` and `git commit` commands, or even `git commit` alone, is restricted in this environment, likely due to security policies.
*   **Actionable Insight:** For Git operations beyond simple status checks or diffs, I must guide the user to perform manual steps in their terminal. This includes staging specific files (`git add -u` for tracked changes, explicit `git add <file>` for untracked files) and then executing the `git commit` and `git checkout -b` commands themselves.

### 4. Proactive Feedback and Debugging Information
*   **Observation:** When a proposed solution doesn't work, immediate and detailed feedback from the user (especially console logs) is critical for efficient debugging.
*   **Actionable Insight:** After implementing changes, always explicitly request the user to provide console output and describe observed behavior to quickly narrow down the problem.

### 5. Regular Commit Reminders
*   **Observation:** The user values regular reminders to commit changes.
*   **Actionable Insight:** I will be more proactive in suggesting commits, especially after significant code modifications, successful feature implementations, or when encountering unexpected issues, to ensure progress is frequently saved.
